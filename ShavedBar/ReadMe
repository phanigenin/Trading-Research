This strategy is a Momemtum-Breakout Strategy. When there is a huge move on the currency in one direction, towards end of the move - the Candle/Bar indicates traders that are taking profits ie the are on a precarious contrarian bet. If on a next candle, this "shave" gets broken, there is a good chance the 
previous momemtum keeps the pair to go through in same direction. This momemtum+Breakout is a function of Flow+Shave+FalseBreak.

FalseBreak will help avoid StopRuns and Thin bout of liqidity in the area.

I had run tests on different pairs on a 1Hour TimeFrame and collected some stats. This can help the TradingBot place trades accordingly. For starters
the Takeprofit-StopLoss arent maximised to the 2:1 desired level. Instead i maximised the Probability of Success,ie Profit Trades/Total Trades.
